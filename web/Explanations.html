    <h1 class="h1-header">Explanation of the website</h1>
    <h5>Our website offers two division algorithms - "Proportional division" and "Jealousy free division".
      <p> Before we will explain how these algorithms work,
       we will explain in general what these concepts means and in what form the input and output are formatted.<br />
      The algorithms work based on the participants' estimates of each of the items,i.e,
      each of the participants gives a numerical value to each of the participating items (see example below). <br>
      Once a participant has evaluated all the items – there are two options to choose from.<br>
      1) Proportional division, in which each participant receives at least 1/n of the sum of the items.<br>
      What does this mean:
      If, for example, there are three participants, Ami, Tami and Rami,<br>
       and the sum of all the items according to Ami's estimate is 1000 so
      Ami will surely get items whose sum of value according to Ami will be at least 333<br>
      - because he should get at least a third of the items. <br>
      - See a more detailed example below.<br>
      2) Division without jealousy, in which each participant receives the largest share according to his assessment.
      That is, if, for example, there are three participants: Ami, Tami and Rami. <br>
      Ami should get a part that,
      according to his own assessment will be larger than Tami's and Rami's parts.<br>
      Rami will get a part that according to his own assessment will be larger than Tami's and Ami's parts.<br>
      Tami will get a part that according to her own assessment will be larger than Rami's and Ami's parts. <br>
      In other words, everyone gets a share that in their opinion is the biggest- and so there is no jealousy in this division.<br>
       See a more detailed example below.</h5>

  <div class="content">
    <h1 class="h1-header">Some additional points</h1>
    <p>- Every division without jealousy is also a proportional division, but it does not work the other way around:
      not every proportional division is without jealousy.<br>
      - So why use a proportional division at all? <br>
      Because it is much faster to calculate and sometimes this condition is enough for us.<br>
      - It is important to note that if a participant gives all the items a very large value, it will not help him because the algorithm works mainly on the relationships between evaluations of the items over the years.<br>
      - And the most important point: our algorithms find divisions with an outcome of minimal sharing of the same item between people.<br>
       For example, let's assume an inheritance of several houses and we want to divide them between 4 brothers. <br>
      It would make little sense that two brothers will get the same house<br>
       (assumable one would own 70% and the other 30%).<br>
       So our algorithms find the divisions with the fewest houses divided into more than one person.<br>

        <h1 class="h1-header">Formulating this example’s numbers:</h1>
        <h3>Suppose we have this estimate:</h3>
       <table border="1" align="center">
        <thead >
          <tr>
            <td> Name </td>
            <td>Regular Apartment   </td>
            <td>Penthouse    </td>
            <td>Ground Floor Apartment   </td>
          </tr>
          <td>Ami </td>
            <td>100</td>
            <td>500</td>
            <td>400</td>

          </tr>
          <td>Tami</td>
            <td>100</td>
            <td>300</td>
            <td>600</td>

          </tr>
          <td>Rami</td>
            <td>250</td>
            <td>100</td>
            <td>650</td>

          </tr>

        </thead>
      </table>
      <p>Ami estimates the ground floor apartment at 400,000,
        the penthouse at half a million and the regular apartment at 100,000 and so on.<br>
        <h3> Proportional Division: </h3>
        <table border="1" align="center">
          <thead >
            <tr>
              <td> Name </td>
              <td>Regular Apartment   </td>
              <td>Penthouse    </td>
              <td>Ground Floor Apartment   </td>
            </tr>
            <td>Ami </td>
              <td>0%</td>
              <td>100%</td>
              <td>0%</td>

            </tr>
            <td>Tami</td>
              <td>75.7%</td>
              <td>0%</td>
              <td>0%</td>

            </tr>
            <td>Rami</td>
              <td>24.3%</td>
              <td>0%</td>
              <td>100%</td>

            </tr>
          </thead>
        </table>
        <p>Let us note that this is indeed a proportional division
          Ami gets the whole penthouse and in his own assessment it's worth 500 which is more than 333.<br>
          Tami's share in her own assessment is 454.2 which is more than 333.<br>
          Remi's share in his view is 407.95 which is more than 333.<br>
          It is worth noting that this is not a division without jealousy because Rami is jealous of Tami:<br>
           Before Rami's estimate his share is 407.95 but according to his estimate Tami's share is 492 so he is jealous of her.<br>

           <h3> Division Without Jealousy: </h3>

               </tr>
             </thead>
           </table>

           <p>According to Ami's assessment:<br>
            <table align="center">
              <thead >
                <tr>
                  <td> <h3>Ami</h3> </td>
                  <td> <h3>Tami</h3>   </td>
                  <td>  <h3>Rami</h3>   </td>

                </tr>
                <td> Ami's share: 1 * 500 = 500<br>
                  Tami's share: 0.65 * 400 = 260<br>
                  Rami's share = 0.35 * 400 + 1 * 100 = 240<br>
                  As you can see Ami is not jealous.<br>  </td>
                  <td>According to Tami:<br>
                    Ami's share: 1 * 300 = 300<br>
                    Tami's share: 0.65 * 600 = 390<br>
                    Rami's share = 0.35 * 600 + 1 * 100 = 310<br>
                    As you can see Tami is not jealous.<br> </td>
                  <td>ccording to Rami:<br>
                    Ami's share: 1 * 100 = 100<br>
                    Tami's share: 0.65 * 650 = 422.5<br>
                    Rami's share = 0.35 * 650 + 1 * 250 = 477.5<br>
                    As you can see Rami is not jealous.</p></td>


                </tr>

              </thead>
            </table>





            <p> Therefore, it is a division without jealousy. <br>
            Let us note that in both divisions only the ground floor apartment is divided between Rami and Tami and our algorithm ensures that this is the minimal option - meaning that it is not possible to divide these items according to these estimates without jealousy with fewer common items.
            Thank you very much and enjoy the website!<br>
